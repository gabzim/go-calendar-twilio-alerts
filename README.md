# go-calendar-twilio-alerts

Ever since I started having more distractions at home (babies, emergencies, etc) I find myself being late for meetings. 
This is an initial implementation that checks my google calendar and places a phone call to my cell whenever a meeting is about to start in case I miss the notifications.
